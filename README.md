Musings of a Hackathon organizer - step by step record of organizing HackUST 2016 &amp; 2017

Hackathon at HKUST, or HackUST for the sake of brevity, is an annual hackathon/conference held at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I was a day volunteer at HackUST 2015, and quickly fell in love with the entrepreneurial buzz and can-do spirit that many participants and organizers exuded. The following year, I volunteered to help organize the conference; I was mostly responsible of event planning and social media, including overseeing the Women Themes portion of the hackathon and organizing a student journalist team to commemorate the journey.
